This is a really painless web gallery maker. 
Fill in the required infos, like the directory containing 
the pictures you want to publish, 
your ftp server, etc. (and save these to a file 
if you're lazy enough and don't want to retype these). 

Click the "OK" button, et voilà, you've got a mail 
telling you to check-out this cool new web gallery.

No php/mysql, just plain simple html/css 

Old and clunky C# webform codebase, but dutofuly do the job
